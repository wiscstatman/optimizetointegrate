Hi Sir,

I have completed the following edits in the EJS_rev3:
https://www.overleaf.com/project/6259d9ba77155bd6ca56382c


(1) I trimmed many steps in the proofs (mostly those steps about satisfying Liapounov sufficient condition), and shortened the Apppendix by 5 pages

(2) I discarded the previous Section 4.2 (previously Simulation part II)

(3) I streamlined the explanations in the Simulation section; we can discuss on whether we still want to retain those total variation results (materials on page 21 and Fig 2 on page 20)

(4) I added a convergence rate result as a corollary at the end of the Appendix section

(5) I already prepared a .tex file 'Response' in the same Overleaf folder/project.


Looking forward to discussing these with you.
