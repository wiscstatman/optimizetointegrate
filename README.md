# optimizetointegrate
Here are files concerning the next-generation of weighted-likeihood bootstrap computations. 

We seek conditions and numerical examples that demonstrate how repeated optimization of a
suitably randomized log-(joint)-posterior gives a sample of optimizers that approximate a
bona fide sample from the corresponding posterior distribution.
