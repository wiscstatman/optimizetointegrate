page 4: on exponential; i.e., each w_j = log(1/u_j) for u_j ~ Uniform(0,1).

page 5: On the `Algorithm`. not sure of the notation `Multi`? Also, I don't think
  we want to normalize w_i for the sample points (at least, you don't do so in
  subsequent examples, and that's my preference too )

convergence on page 6 is conditional upon data, a.s. [there is potential for 
 confusion if you think of the marginal dist of object on left, which is different...]

page 8, above 5...may not want bold w_i's
