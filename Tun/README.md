We consider a general-purpose approximation approach to Bayesian inference in which repeated optimization of a randomized objective function provides surrogate samples from the joint posterior distribution. In the context of LASSO regression, we repeatedly assign independently-drawn random weights to terms in the objective function, and optimize to obtain the surrogate samples. 

In our manuscript [arXiv:2002.02629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02629), we show that existing approaches  have conditional model selection consistency and conditional asymptotic normality at different growth rates of the regularization parameter as sample size increases. We  propose an extension to the available random-weighting methods and establish that the resulting samples attain conditional sparse normality and conditional consistency in a growing-dimension setting. We find that random-weighting has both approximate-Bayesian and sampling-theory interpretations.    

This repo contains the slides for my [JSM 2021 presentation](https://github.com/ngtunlee/random-weighting-Lasso/blob/master/speed_slides.pdf). The presentation was also pre-recorded and shared as a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOPBIVL5SNI). This repo also has the [R codes for simulations](https://github.com/ngtunlee/random-weighting-Lasso/blob/master/Simulation.R) and analysis of the ['Boston Housing'](https://github.com/ngtunlee/random-weighting-Lasso/blob/master/03_boston.R) benchmark data example.
