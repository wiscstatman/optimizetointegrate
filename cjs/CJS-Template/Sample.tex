Insert your abstract here; it should
typically be up to ten lines long. Avoid symbols as much as possible. Formulas
are strongly discouraged, and citations should be avoided. 
The title and the abstract should be concise and descriptive;
list the key words in alphabetical order.  The MSC 2010 subject classification codes can be found here:

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Your text starts here. For English spelling,
we follow the style of the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (Barber, 2004).  
If the dictionary lists more than one acceptable spelling, choose the main entry.

Manuscripts may be submitted in either English or French.  We do accept submissions in Microsoft Word.  We do not provide a Word template, and we ask you to follow the general instructions in this document.

\subsection{Subsections start this way}
Refer to papers by authors (date) throughout. For example,
you might quote Author1 \& Author2 (1986a,~b) or Author (1987, 1992) or 
Author1, Author2, \& Author3 (2011). If there
are four authors or more, refer to (for example) Author1 et al.\ (1990).

When references are in parentheses, separate them by a semicolon and do not
put brackets around the year (e.g., Author1 \& Author2, 1994; Author3 \&
Author4, 1999).

\section{MATHEMATICAL TYPESETTING}
Symbols should not be used at the start of a sentence, and footnotes are not allowed. Try to avoid double subscripts, and never use triple subscripts. Unless central or essential to the flow of the discussion, mathematical arguments should be deferred to the Appendix.
Note that equations should be numbered consecutively, i.e., (1), (2), etc. Number
\textit{only} those equations that are referred to in the text.  Punctuation should be given after equations. Equations should be cited as, for example, Equation (6) or Equations (6)--(8). Within parentheses use an abbreviation: (Eq. 7).

Likewise, number consecutively your definitions, lemmas, propositions,
theorems, corollaries and the like. For example:

\begin{theorem}{Theorem 1.}{}%
Here is the statement of our theorem.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}{Proof}{}%
We prove our theorem using Equation (\ref{Einstn}) below:
\begin{equation}
e = mc^2.
\label{Einstn}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

\section{FIGURES AND TABLES}
When you submit the final version of your manuscript in
\LaTeX \, form, please include postscript files (.ps or .eps) for the figures,
labelling them fig1.ps, fig2.ps, etc. When referring to a figure, spell out the word (e.g., Figure 1) whether or not it is in parentheses.

% Instructions for a figure
%\begin{figure}
%\centerline{\epsfbox{gr1.eps}}
%\caption{This is a full width figure}
%\end{figure}

See Table 1 for an example table layout; note that we do not use
vertical lines between columns.  The data in this table are from Genest (1999).

\begin{table}
% Next comes the table caption

\begin{ack}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
Place all acknowledgements here.  In your initial and revised submission, ensure that any acknowledgements are anonymous; include the full acknowledgements only after your paper has been accepted. Granting agencies should not be abbreviated, and do not include grant numbers.  We are grateful for your assistance with our publication process.\\

A note on references: they should be listed alphabetically. Initials should be separated by blank characters and
journal names should be {\it in italics}. Don't use boldface for volume
number and separate pages by two dashes.
Abbreviations should not be used for authors' or journal's names, nor for the titles of the articles.
