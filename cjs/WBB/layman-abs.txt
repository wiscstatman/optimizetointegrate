Title: Weighted Bayesian bootstrap for scalable posterior distributions 

Layman's abstract:

Contemporary data analysis aims to recover information from large, high-dimensional, and highly 
structured data sets.   Statistical models play an impoortant role in this recovery task, and a
great deal of research has advanced the state of the art in learning parameters of such models,
for example using sophisticated optimization algorithms.  Coupled with parameter learning is the
task to assess uncertainty in the reported parameter estimates.  Bayesian analysis provides a
formal framework for uncertainty quantification, but there continue to be limitations with available
computational methods to calculate uncertainties in many models.  The propoosed Weighted Bayesian
Bootstrap (WBB) is a

We introduce and develop a weighted Bayesian bootstrap (WBB) for  Machine Learning and Statistics. WBB provides uncertainty quantification by sampling from a high dimensional posterior distribution. WBB is computationally fast and scalable using only off-the-shelf optimization software.  First-order asymptotic analysis provides a theoretical justification
under suitable regularity conditions on the statistical model.
We illustrate the proposed
methodology in regularized regression, trend filtering and deep learning and conclude with directions for future research.
