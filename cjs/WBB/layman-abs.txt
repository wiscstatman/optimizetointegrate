Title: Weighted Bayesian bootstrap for scalable posterior distributions 

Layman's abstract:

Contemporary data analysis aims to recover information from large, high-dimensional, and highly structured data sets.   Statistical models play an impoortant role in this recovery task, and a great deal of research has advanced methods for learning parameters of such models, for example using sophisticated optimization algorithms.  Coupled with parameter learning is the task to assess uncertainty in the reported parameter estimates.  Bayesian analysis provides a formal framework for uncertainty quantification via posterior sampling, but there continue to be limitations with available computational methods to calculate uncertainties in many models.  Through a specific randomization approach, the propoosed Weighted Bayesian Bootstrap (WBB) leverages optimization tools to provide approximate posterior samples when modeling involves penalized likelihoods.   Theoretical and numerical calculations provide support for the WBB in regularized regression, trend filtering and deep learning examples.
